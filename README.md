# Academics Website
The creation of this website began at the start of my role as the Vice-President of Academics of the Association of Mathematical and Computer Science Students at the University of Toronto at Scarborough. It was created to act as a place where I could display all the information regarding the academic activities of the association, and where I could upload all the study material we provide.

# Status
The website is currently just a static HTML website. It is functional and provides all the necessary information, but it requires improvements. I am in the process of adding more functionality to it using Javascript and perhaps Django or Flask.

# To-DO
- Add CSS Styling
- Include some Javascript code to provide more functionality and usability to the website
- Develop an easier method of adding/changing information on the website instead of editing the HTML source code
